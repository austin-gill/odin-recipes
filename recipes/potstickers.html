        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups finely chopped green cabbage</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Dough:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 cup hot water, about 130-150 F (55-65 C)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Dipping Sauce:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup seasoned rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For Frying:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>6 tablespoons vegetable oil for frying, or as needed - divided</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons water for steaming, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place ground pork, green onions, garlic, ginger, 2 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon 
            soy sauce, sesame oil, and cayenne in a mixing bowl. Top with chopped green cabbage. 
            Mix with fork until thoroughly combined. Tamp down lightly; cover with plastic. 
            Refrigerate until chilled, about an hour. </li>
        <li>Place 2 1/2 cups of flour and kosher salt in a mixing bowl. Slowly pour in hot water. 
            Stir with a wooden spoon until mixture forms a shaggy dough. Flour your hands and 
            transfer dough to a work surface. Knead dough until it becomes smooth and elastic, 
            about 3 to 5 minutes. If dough seems too sticky, sprinkle with a bit more flour, up 
            to an additional 1/2 cup, and continue to knead. Wrap dough ball in plastic, and let 
            it rest about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>When dough has rested, divide into 4 equal pieces. Cover 3 pieces with a dish cloth 
            while you work the first piece. Roll into a small log about the thickness of a thumb, 
            about 3/4 inch. Divide each log into 6 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a thin 
            3 1/2-inch circle on a lightly floured surface to form the pot sticker wrappers. 
            Repeat with the remaining dough pieces. </li>
        <li>Lightly moisten the edges of a wrapper with your wet finger. Place a small scoop of 
            the ground pork mixture onto the center of a wrapper. Fold up the 2 sides and pinch 
            together in the center. Pinch together the remaining edges, forming "pleats" along 
            one side. Tap the pot sticker on the work surface to slightly flatten the bottom; form 
            a slight curve in it so it stands upright in the pan. Transfer to a well-floured plate. 
            Repeat with remaining dough and filling. </li>
        <li>Mix together seasoned rice vinegar and soy sauce in a small mixing bowl for the dipping sauce. </li>
        <li>Heat oil in skillet over medium-high heat. Place about 6 or 7 pot stickers in the hot oil, 
            flat side down. Cook until bottoms are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Drizzle in water and 
            quickly cover the pan; steam for 3 minutes. Uncover; reduce heat to medium. Continue cooking 
            until water evaporates and bottoms are browned and crunchy, 1 or 2 minutes. Transfer to a 
            warm serving dish. Repeat with remaining pot stickers. Serve with dipping sauce. </li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
